## üöÄ Features

- **Instant Calculation**: Input your machine specs and get optimal gear sets instantly
- **Error Validation**: Shows actual lead and percentage error for precision work
- **Standard Gear Sets**: Uses common gear tooth combinations (20, 28, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 90, 100)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Enter Desired Lead**: Input the helical lead you want to achieve (in mm)
2. **Set Machine Parameters**: 
   - Leadscrew Pitch (typically 4-5 mm for metric machines)
   - Dividing Head Ratio (usually 40:1)
3. **Get Results**: The calculator displays:
   - Optimal 4-gear combination (A, B, C, D)
   - Actual achieved lead and error percentage
   - Machine lead constant

### Example
```yaml
Input:
- Desired Lead: 56.0 mm
- Leadscrew Pitch: 4.5 mm  
- Dividing Head Ratio: 40

Output:
- Gear Set: 20 √ó 90 / 20 √ó 28
- Actual Lead: 56.000 mm
- Error: 0.000%
